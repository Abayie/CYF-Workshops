You've started to see **assertions** in your coursework that look something like this:

```js
expect(sum(10,32)).toBe(42);
```

a) Describe, in your own words, what the above assertion checks.
        I think the above assertion is making the sum of 10,32 to be 42.
Now try the following:

b) Write an **assertion** that checks that a function `isMultipleOfTen` returns `true` when called with the input `80`
```js
expect(isMultipleOfTen(10,32).toBe(80)); 
```
