# Code comprehension

Remember to **preview a markdown file** on your computer you can do:
Ctrl + Shift + V (Windows/Linux) or CMD + Shift + V (Mac)

Consider the code in this program below:

```js
function calculateSum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

function logSum(a, b) {
  console.log(a + b);
}

const result1 = calculateSum(10, 32);
const result2 = logSum(10, 32);
```

a) what will `result1` evaluate to? Explain your answer
    The answer will be 42 because we are calculating the sum of two numbers and the parameters are given as 10,32
b) What will `result2` evaluate to? Explain your answer
    The answer will be 42 because we are calculating the sum of two numbers and the parameters are given as 10,32

c) Try to summarise the main difference between `logSum` and `calculateSum`
