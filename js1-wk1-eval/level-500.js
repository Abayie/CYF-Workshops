const avgDaysInMonth = Math.floor(365 / 12);

// Without running any code,
// Predict and explain what the value of avgDaysInMonth will evaluate to
// avgDaysInMonth will evaluate to 30. This is because we are dividing 365 (the total number of days in a year) by 12 (the number of months in a year) and then using Math.floor to round down the result to the nearest whole number.
// You can use documentation to look up what Math.floor does
// Math.floor() rounds a number down to the nearest integer, regardless of the decimal part. In this case, 365 / 12 equals approximately 30.416666666666668, and Math.floor() will round it down to 30.
